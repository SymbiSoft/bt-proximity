BT-Proximity is a project aimed to detect distance of a blue tooth enabled device using PyS60 and therefore the python language.

i hope to one day produce a bluetooth distance calculator from this. maybe even a radar type device, but that's not currently attainable.

Currently working on:
GUI - now completed, see video.

Current Release :
BTNumberflowV1.py - this is a simple proof of concept that you can try yourself
